# STUDENTS-ATTENDANCE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT
Integrity and sincerity are the pillars of a successful learning space. But these factors
do not come complimentary. They need to be developed and inculcated by forming
a disciplined and well-regulated study environment. To achieve this discipline, it is
essential to monitor students and keep a track of their devotion to their work and
their class presence. Attendance Management is one such method that allows the
professor and the college management to keep an eye on the presence, absence of
the student in the class. Digitalization of the same makes it straightforward effortless
and non-manipulative. Conventionally an Attendance Management system could be
understood as a set of methods and procedures which are carried out for the purpose
of regulating students’ attendance

## INTRODUCTION
In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom
time, teachers need EdTech tools which help them manage precious class time
efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with
completing formal duties, for e.g., taking daily student attendance. Manually taking
attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a
mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time. To
overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems
available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online
attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which
is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to
maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports
Attendance management system keeps track of daily attendance of students. This
backend module can be integrated with an interface to ensure better useability.
